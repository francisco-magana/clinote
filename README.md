Clinote is a CLI tool to take notes in your terminal. Is easy to use and personal. All the notes taked with the app are stored in a local JSON file. Don't write personal information if someone more can use your computer.

Clinote allow us to create, update, delete or read our personal notes in an easy way without leaving the terminal.

## Why a note app in our Terminal?
