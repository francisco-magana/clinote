# Clinote

Clinote is a CLI tool to take notes in your terminal. Is easy to use and personal. All the notes taked with the app are stored in a local JSON file.

Clinote allow us to create, update, delete or read our personal notes in an easy way as a programmer.

## Why a note app in our Terminal?

As programmers, the terminal is one of our day to day tools. Have tools to do things faster without another application is a great way to improve our workflow.

This CLI is only for personal note taking, if you want to store something confidential this is not the best option.

You can create a personal password for your notes to protect access from the terminal.

# USAGE
